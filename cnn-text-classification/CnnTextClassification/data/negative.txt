simplistic , silly and tedious .
it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .
exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable .
[garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation .
a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification .
the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count .
about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time .
not so much farcical as sour .
unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script .
all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject .
a sentimental mess that never rings true .
